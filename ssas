Data source
-just a connect to database

Data source view(DSV)
- the data source view contains a set of tables or views, and defines the relationships among them. 
- Each DSV is usually built around a business topic, and contains any tables related to that topic
- DSV is very useful by letting you augment the schema, through Named Query and Named Calculation
- For example, you can add calculated column to DSV when you can't make the actuarial change on physical table in db


Manipulate data in DSV(Named query and Named calculation)

Named query in DSV
- creates a new logical table in DSV, or replace an existing table. 
- A fully select statement

Named calculation in DSV
- add a computed column in DSV table

Dimension(Cube)
- Hierachiy(Balanced, Unblanced, Ragged):
  Balanced or not: if each branch contains the same number of levels
  Ragged or not: if for level, the parent leval comes from the level that is immediatelly above it(no level skip)
- Attribute relationship(flexible vs rigid) - relationship betwwn a pair of columns
  Flexible: eg. Actuarial Developmetn Group move from Act to IT, company re-organize
  Rigit: date dimension
  
Measure
- like a column in fact table
- like a fact table
- numberical

Dimension Usage/Dimension relationship(defines how cube dimensions are used within each measure group)
- relation between measure group and dimension
- regular: normal one to many relationship. PK, FK(dimension and fact relation)
- referenced: dimension A,B and Fact. chained 1-many(B-->A-->fact)
- fact: degenarated dimension, eg: reciept number
- many to many: eg. bank transaction[fact],account[dim],customer[dim], assume a regular relation between DimAccount and FactTrans,
  however, there is a many to many relationship between dimAcccount and dimCustomer, then you will have many to many betwenn FactTrans
  and dimCustomer[this basically mean a cu
