database space = data file size + log file size
data file size = reserved space + un-allocated space(extents that haven't been touched)
reserved space = data size + index size + unused

un-allocatied space = extents that haven't been allocated
un-used = empty page on allocated extents
reserved = allocated
reserved space = acturial data space to look at
db size = total space claimed for os


shrink DB is to reclaim space from os, space affected is un-allocated part

---------------------------->total space
----------------------->data file space
