Set the properties of step 1 to be:

on success, go to step 2
on failure, go to step N
Step 2 -> n-1 would do their normal things. Step n-1 might quit the job with success on success, or move to step N on success.

Step N could be as simple as:

PRINT 1;
...and would be set to quit the job with success.
