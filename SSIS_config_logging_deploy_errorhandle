CONFIGURATION
config for package deployment model
a. XML, SQL server table, Parent package variable, system environment variable, register entry
b. package configuration wizard

config for project deployment model
a. parameterization, Master-Child packages,SSIS catelog environment


DEPLOYMENT
a. package deployment model
-unit of deployment: a package
-destination: File System or MSDB
-configuration: configuration files(.dtsConfig)
-manifest file
-CreateDeploymentUtility need to set to TRUE

b. project deployment model(introduced in SSIS 2012, utilize SSISDB catelog, a sign of integreated SSIS to sql server)
-unit of deployment: a project
-destination: SSISDB(a db on the server), a central repo 
-Configuration: environment variable
-Create a SSISDB catelog first if not exist, build(will generate .ispac file)

c. incremental package deployment(introduced in SSIS 2016)
- deploy one or more packages without deploying the whole project

Security
-protection level: by default, encrypt sensitive with user key
-target: all(whole package), sensitive(e.g. passwords)
-option: don't save sensitive, protect with user key, protect with password

-encrypt all with user key
  only the person who developed the pkg/project can open
  typical for single use mode, can't share
  
-encrypt sensitive with user key(default, commonly used one)
  only the person who developed the pkg/project have access to sensitive
  general user will lose sensitive
  if there is no sensitive data(which is the common case), then this open don't have any protection

-encrypt sensitive with password: 
  project protect level must be also changed to sensitive with password. they have to be consistent
  when open project -->prompt password, for sensitive data; open without password will lose sensitive data --> once in project, no password required for package
  when open package(not from project)--> prompt for password; open without password will lose sensitive data
  
-encrypt all with password:
  project protect level must be consitent
  when open project --> prompt for password --> once in project, no need to enter password to package
  when open package(not from project) --> prompt for password 



ERROR HANDLEING
a. control flow level
- on failure precedence constraint
- event handler: On failure, On Error
b. data flow level
- error output: ignore, fail component, redirect rows

LOGGING
a. build in logging providers
-text files, xml files, sql server table, sql profiler(.trc), windows event log
b. event handler
-comment event: on pre-execution, on post-execution, on fail, on error
-customized logging: eg. execute sql task to wrap up stored procedure to logging into db
c. SSISDB catelog(for packages run through SSISDB catelog, log to sql server)
-for a given package, the logging level incl: none/basic(default)/verbose + Performance(for performance related statistics)



SSISDB & SSISDB catalog
ON SQL SERVER 2012 or later version
you will see a node 'Integreation Services Catelogs' when you login to database engine.
To deploy with project deployment mode, you will need to create a SSIS catelog first
When it is created, you will found two new item
- a database named 'SSISDB' under database node, this will be like a central repo for your packages(incl. packages, parameters, permission...)
- a catelog name 'SSISDB' under note integration server catelogs, this is the so called 'SSIS catelog'
SSISDB catelog = catelog 'SSISDB'under node Integration Services Catelogs
