This is summarized from SQL Server Security Model By Gregory A. Larsen

Authentification
Window
  domain window account: defined to Active Directory
  domain window group: unique name you define to Active Directory, can have members
  local window account: defined to the local machine for local Windows accounts
  local window group
SQL SERVER --defined only within SQL Server. Not known to the AD


Login
Window Login: define window account in AD or local machine and then create SQL server login
SQL server login: directly create in sql server as a SQL server account

Associating Permissions to Login
  Server lever rights - by assocate Login to a server wide role
    -8 server roles with different rights
    -can not add own custom server wide role
  Database Access
    -for a login to perform T-SQL statements against a database, they need to be given access to that database.
    -When a login is granted access to a database, a user within the database is identified and created.
    -Granting a login access to a database doesnâ€™t give them any access to objects within a database
    -Still need to grant rights specifically to db user, or add db user to a member of a role
