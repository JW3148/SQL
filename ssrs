SSRS

configuration
report manager

Row group
-visibility(hide, display can be toggled by item)
  -drill down
-page break
-sorting
-

Test Box property
-alignment
-front
-Action(Important)
-interactive sorting

Actions
-Go to report
-Go to bookmark
-Go to URL

Tablix vs. Matrix
Tablix only row group 

Parameters
-prompt
-data type
-allow null/blank/multi-value
-visibility: visible, invisible(drill trough), internal(user has not vis or control, can't not (change)call by another report at run time, can only change by developer)
-available values: none(usr input), specify values, from query; value and label
-default values

Cascading Parameter
-eg. country,state,city
-step1 define parameter P_country,P_state,P_city by dataset(query), without building any dependence
-step2 Embed dependence, add where clause to the query that defines state(where country=@P_country) and city(where country=@P_country and state=@P_state)

Issue with mult-selection 
-in query, need to change to use 'in'
-in stored procedure, 
  -input variable can only be scalar variable--> need to combine the array to a string (use join function in SSRS, at parameter mapping property of dataset, with expression)
  -inside the stored procedure, the query will be"in"-->need to convert it to back to array, user defined function to do this

Subscription
-Schedule
-email/file system/
-standard vs. data driven(stores preference for each user in a table in db)

Parameter in dataset vs Filter
-cache
-parameter(filter done in DB engine), Filter(filter done in report server)

Admin
-Princeple, Role, Permission
-serveral default roles

Prcessing Option
-Always run with most recent data(diffrent cache options: a. expire cache every 30 min; b.expire cache on specified schedule )
-Rendering from a snapshot(historical report)

Pre-condition for snapshot and subscription
-SQL Agent
-No user profile
-stored credential

Report Type
-standard
-parameterized
-drill down(row group, invisiable, toggle by parent 
-drill through(go to report, parameter mapping)
-sub-report
-bookmark, document map(index, set up on row group)
-Viz(chart,sparkline,databar, indicator)
-chart(value(y), catagory groups(x), series groups(z, another category, say..make a line chart with multiple lines)

-Issue with rendering
The common rendering problem happen when we want to export report as PDF file, Excel file or CSV file.  
- For PDF file, sometimes we may find unexpected blank pages after export. The problem is as a result of the unused white space in the design page. 
The solution is to compress page items, and set the propery ConsumeContainerWhiteSpace as True. 
- For Excel, we may find merged cells in the exported file. This is not good for many excel functions. Such as pivot table.  
A solution is to try to move header to align with the cell or table. 
- For CSV file, we may find that it displays the textbox number instead of column name. 
To solve this, we need to change the name property of textbox to column name
