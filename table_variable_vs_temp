table variable, cte, tempt table

-lifetime
table variable is batch bound
cte only works with the query immediately follows
tempt table is session bound

-transaction
For this reason a ROLLBACK command will affect a #temp table but leave the @table_variable untouched.

-statistics
columns statistics is maintained on temp table, but not table variable
