--compression
two types

a. row level:
   -turning fixed length data to variable length, like decimal(38,2)
   -more rows can fit to a single page
b. page level
   -can page by page?
   -start with row-level data compression
   -two features: prefix and dictionary
   -prefix compression: repeating patterns of data at the beginning of the values of a columns
    are removed, substuted with an abbreviated reference, mapping is stored in a structure that 
    follows the page header of the data page. it affects a particular column
   -dictionary compression: search for repeated values anywhere on a page, stores them in the 
    mapping structure(compress information). it affects a data page

CPU vs I/O trade off

Syntax
