solution to forgot adding an admin account during install


if you don't specify an admin account during installation
when you login, you will only have read access(public role), can not do any thing

you can still log on because of the 'Buildin\Users' group

During setup of SQL Server Express a login is added for the BUILTIN\Users group. 
This allows all authenticated users of the computer to access the instance of SQL Server Express as a member of the public role. 
The BUILTIN\Users login can be safely removed to restrict Database Engine access to computer users who have individual logins
or are members of other Windows groups with logins.


In this situation, you lock yourself out, 

you will need to restart the server in single user mode

to add the admin back
a) stop the service
b) navigate to the folder that has the server executable, run the following in cmd
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\Binn

sqlservr -m -s SQLEXPRESS(server name)      (-m means mono, -s means server name)
THIS WILL START THE SERVER IN SINGLE USER MODE
c) add new login, assign the right role, or you can choose to assigna sysadmin to BUILTIN\User group


Why you need single user?
Starting SQL Server in single-user mode enables any member of the computer's local Administrators group 
to connect to the instance of SQL Server as a member of the sysadmin fixed server role.

Pre-condition: you must be a member of the computer's local admin group
